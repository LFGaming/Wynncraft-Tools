# Wynncraft-Tools

This is a Repo with various tools and utilities I made for my Wynncraft gameplay. Some need [Wynntils](https://wynntils.com/) to work, other need hardware or are completely standalone.

At this moment in this repository:

### Wynntils:
- [**Bonfire Event**](./Wynntills/Bonfire%20Event/): Here are the locations of the 2025 Bonfire event Bonfires.
  - In [bonfire_route.json](./Wynntills/Bonfire%20Event/bonfire_route.json) there is a shortes route for all the bonfires calculated with Dijkstra's Algorithm.
  - [bondire.py](./Wynntills/Bonfire%20Event/bonfire.py) is a script to convert a file with coordinates to a Wynntils importable map location format.
- [**Chest folder**](./Wynntills/Chests): My updated chest locations, which was started here: [Wynncraft Forums](https://forums.wynncraft.com/threads/wynntils-loot-chest-waypoint-hunt.262837/). 
  - In this folder there is also a python file to remove duplicates and remove old named chests.
